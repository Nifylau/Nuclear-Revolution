# Nuclear-Revolution

Thank you for installing my modpack! 


## Installation: 

Installing the pack is very simple, just drag and drop the .zip file in releases into multimc, prisim, or modrinth launcher. Please report errors in the project issues.
In order to run you need Java 8 installed on your computer.

## Q: Where is are all the mods?

All the mods will be installed automatically on the first launch of the game. You will not have to re-download the pack from GitHub unless a significant change happens.
