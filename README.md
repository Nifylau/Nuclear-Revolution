# Nuclear-Revolution

Thank you for choosing my modpack! 


## Installation: 

### Step 1:

Ensure that you have JRE 1.8.0.442 installed on your system, if you do not, download and restart if promoted.

A reliable link to download this version is as followed:
https://adoptium.net/temurin/archive/?version=8

### Step 2:

Install MultiMC, Prism, or Modrinth launcher. This pack is not compatible with the curseforge launcher.

### Step 3:

Download the latest release. Do not unzip, just drag and drop it into the instance manager you installed in step 2. 

### Step 4: 

After pack installation is complete, enter the instance settings and under "Java", click "Auto Detect". Select "javaw" and make sure it is version 1.8.0.442.

### Step 5:

Click "Launch" or double click the modpack icon.
Select any optional mods, and click continue.

### If it doesn't work:

If the pack fails to install due to invalid hash, please notify me in the "Issues" tab or on discord. 

If it is not a failure to install error, please review your java version or installation process as that is the most likely issue.

Any launch failure errors should be reported immediately, after checking that installation was done according to the instructions. Include your latest.log file in your report in addition to the crash report.


## Q: Where is are all the mods?

All the mods will be installed automatically on the first launch of the game. You will not have to re-download the pack from GitHub unless a significant change happens.

## Q: It says that the zip doesn't contain a modpack in it.

Make sure that you have downloaded the latest release and not the source code for the project.

## Q: Does it work on 'X' system?

This modpack should function on any system which can run Minecraft, including MacOS and common Linux distros. At least 6GB of memory is recommended.
